*An advanced system for recognizing human activities in video data through skeleton-based analysis*

</div>

## üåü Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive solution for human activity recognition in video data using skeletal keypoint extraction and deep learning. The system follows a two-stage approach:

1. **Keypoint Extraction**: Uses MMPOSE to detect and extract human keypoints from video frames
2. **Activity Recognition**: Employs two different models for comparison:
   - CNN-Transformer
   - CNN-LSTM

## üöÄ Features

- Efficient human pose estimation with MMPOSE
- Keypoint normalization for improved recognition
- Two powerful deep learning architectures for comparison
- Interactive GUI for easy model inference


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)

- Install MMPOSE to the environment (GitHub: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose)
- Download required MMPOSE model weights:
   ```bash
   # Place these files in the root directory:
   # - td-hm_hrnet-w48_8xb32-210e_coco-256x192-0e67c616_20220913.pth
   # - td-hm_hrnet-w48_8xb32-210e_coco-256x192.pth
   ```
- Download the dataset:
   ```bash
   python dataset_downloader.py
   ```

## üíª Usage

### Running the GUI

```bash
python main.py
```

This launches the interactive GUI where you can:
- Load video files
- Choose between CNN-Transformer or CNN-LSTM models
- Load the model fine and the label encoder file
- View real-time activity recognition results
